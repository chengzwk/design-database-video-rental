# Design a database for a video-rental management application

This project is a course project from the [Complete SQL Mastery course](https://members.codewithmosh.com/courses/enrolled/525068) by Code with Mosh.  
In this project, we design a database for a desktop application called Vidly, which will be used at a video rental store.

## Description

We follow these steps of data modeling:

- Understand the business requirements
- Build a conceptual model
- Build a logical model
- Build a physical model

In this project, our purpose is to design a database to record necessary data, as well as manage different levels of
permissions for different users for the desktop application Vidly. 
See the project description file "PROJECT-Video-Rental-Application.pdf" for detailed requirements.

### Files

- The conceptual model and logical model are generated by [draw.io](draw.io).
- The physical model is generated in MySQLWorkbench, and exported as png for preview.
